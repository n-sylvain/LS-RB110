a = 2
b = [5, 8]
arr = [a, b] # => [2, [5, 8]]

arr[0] += 2  # => 4
arr[1][0] -= a # => [2, [3, 8]]

# a would be 2
# b would be [1, 8]

# The value of a didn't change because we are not referencing a at any point.
# This code arr[0] += 2 was modifying the array, arr not a. In effect we are assigning a new object at
# that index of the array so that instead of arr[0] containing a it now contains 4 - we can check this by
# looking at the value of arr: arr # => [4, [3, 8]]
# The value of b did change because b is an array and we are modifying that array by assigning
# a new value at index 0 of that array.
